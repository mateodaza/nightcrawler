# Cross-vendor: Codex (a different vendor) reviews Claude's change.

# Usage:  codex_review.sh <worktree> [task-context] [round]
#
# Notes:
# - Model is intentionally NOT hardcoded (names drift). Pin it via codex config
#   or pass `-m <model>` here once you've chosen one.
# - The infra-vs-findings guard lives in adapter.py: a nonzero exit or empty
#   output becomes ran:false, NOT a rejection. Do not "fix" that here.
# - AUDIT: each run persists Codex's raw response to ~/.nightcrawler/reviews/<wt>-r<round>.json
#   (proof the review actually ran; a MISSING file for a round means the script never ran).
