# Camus

**An autonomous coding loop that can't grade its own homework.**

Camus runs a coding task from plan to verified commit without you watching it.
Claude writes the code. Codex, a different vendor's model, reviews every change.
Then your repo's own type-check and tests decide. No step in the chain is allowed
to approve its own work.

It runs as two Claude Code workflows plus a skill: `/camus-loop` takes one task,
`/camus-feat` takes an ordered task list and ships it as one feature branch with a
report. Formerly Nightcrawler v2; the v1 bash orchestrator lives at the repo root.
Full design: [`../CAMUS-SPEC.md`](../CAMUS-SPEC.md).

```
plan → implement → [ Codex review ↔ fix ]* → commit gate → dep prep → verify
       loops while P0/P1/P2 findings remain, round cap 3
```

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** v2.1.154+ with dynamic workflows, on a subscription plan.
  Camus runs interactively, so usage counts against your plan limits rather than
  metered API credit.
- **Codex CLI** installed and authenticated (ChatGPT plan or API key). This is the
  reviewer. Without it, nothing gets approved.
- **node ≥ 18**, **python3**, **git**. The gate scripts are pure stdlib.
- A repo you trust. The verifier runs that repo's own build and test commands.

## Why you can trust a green run

**The reviewer is a different vendor.** Codex reviews; a thin runner relays its JSON
verbatim. Claude never re-judges the verdict. Each round starts a fresh Codex session
so old findings get re-raised instead of politely dropped. Every round is also written
to `~/.camus/reviews/`. If that file is missing, the review binary never ran.

**Tests are the last word.** A clean review does not ship code that fails
`type-check` or `test`. The verifier auto-detects the stack (node, python, rust, go,
foundry, make) or uses `CAMUS_VERIFY_CMD`. If it finds no verifier at all, that is a
loud failure, not a pass.

**A broken environment never reads as broken code.** Codex failing to run is
`ran:false`: retried, never fed to the fix loop, never counted as clean. Missing
`node_modules` is `verify_inconclusive`, not `verify_failed`. This distinction is the
#1 defense against runaway loops, and it is enforced in the adapter, not in a prompt.

**Work provably lands.** After review passes, a commit gate stages and commits the
worktree. Nothing staged means `no_changes`; the task is reported as a no-op, never
silently marked done. Every `done` carries its `commit_sha`.

## Autonomy controls

- **Zero-click runs.** `camus auto-setup` installs a narrow permission profile: one
  egress trust line for the review diff, plus allow rules for the five gate scripts.
  Not `bypassPermissions`, no broad shell access. The runner agents' routine git
  plumbing is approved by Claude Code's auto-mode classifier; the profile and the
  classifier together are what make runs prompt-free.
- **It asks when it should.** `policy: autonomous | ask_on_ambiguity (default) |
  ask_on_major`. A genuinely ambiguous task halts with a question (`needs_human`);
  resuming with your answer re-runs just that task.
- **Decisions are reported.** Every judgment call the implementer makes (say,
  widening a parameter type) lands in the report with the reason and the rejected
  alternative. You review decisions, not just diffs.
- **Models are routed, then escalated.** A cheap classify pass sends trivial tasks to
  Sonnet and the rest to Opus. If review findings persist past round 2, or any P0
  appears, the fix model escalates automatically. Override with `model:` or `modelTier:`.
- **Interrupted runs resume.** `camus resume` lists interrupted feats with their
  exact original arguments. Finished tasks skip; the unfinished one re-runs.
- **Gate scripts are fenced in.** Every script checks it is operating on the calling
  repo, a `camus/*` branch, and a `camus-wt-*` worktree. Anything else is rejected.

## Layout

```
camus/
  bin/camus.js            # CLI; dispatches to install.sh, adds no logic of its own
  install.sh              # install / check / auto-setup / env-check
  merge_settings.py       # permission-profile merger (preserves your settings)
  workflows/
    camus-loop.workflow.js   # one task
    camus-feat.workflow.js   # ordered task list as one feature
  skills/camus/
    SKILL.md              # severity model, hard rules, run surface
    review-prompt.md      # Codex's audit persona and completeness check
    sev.schema.json       # Codex --output-schema
    scripts/              # gate scripts, guard, adapter; all unit-tested
```

## Install

```bash
npm i -g camus
camus install        # copy skill + workflows into ~/.claude (a frozen copy, not a symlink)
camus check          # exit 0 = installed matches package. Run before every auto run.
camus env-check .    # will this repo's toolchain actually run? (node version, deps)
camus auto-setup     # optional: the zero-click permission profile
```

From a checkout: `npm i -g ./camus` from the repo root, or run `./install.sh`
directly inside `camus/`. The CLI and the shell script are the same entrypoints.

## Run

From your repo:

```bash
camus check
export CAMUS_REPO_ROOT="$(pwd -P)"
export CAMUS_VERIFY_CMD="pnpm type-check && pnpm test"   # include tests, not only types
claude --permission-mode auto
```

Then `/camus-feat` with your task list, or `/camus-loop <one task>`. The feature
report lands in `~/.camus/reports/<featId>.json`. The branch is left for you to merge.

## Tests

Pure stdlib, no network, no dependencies. 163 assertions across 9 suites:

```bash
npm test    # or run the suites individually under skills/camus/scripts/
```

The cross-vendor gate has reviewed its own adapter, guard, and workflows, and caught
real bugs each time.

## Boundary

Camus is for code you already trust. The verifier executes the repo's own build and
test commands; on an untrusted repo that is remote code execution. Never run it as
root. Camus may improve itself only through tasks that pass its own gates. It never
touches its runner, skill, verifier, schemas, or permissions during a run.
